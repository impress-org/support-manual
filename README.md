# GiveWP Support Manual

This is the GiveWP Support Manual. This is what we expect all our Support Technicians to know and do like the backs of their hands. 

The purpose of this Manual is to provide support technicians with a guide which will help them excel in their day-to-day tasks. This isn't supposed to be a list of regulations or "rules" that are burdensome, but rather guideliness based on years of experience to empower success.

This is published publicly for anyone to reference or fork for their own purposes.
