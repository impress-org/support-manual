## What is Frictionless Support?

One of the biggest pain points for customers in any sort of support interaction is the feeling of being made to jump through hoops or repeat themselves because they didn't use the correct channel. 

We call this "friction" and it is the enemy of providing excellent support. The different types of friction generally fall into three types:

1. Customers with urgent issues who need immediate attention from any technicians who are still working.
1. Customers who ask for something other than technical support in the Support inbox.
1. Customers who require answers that only the Head of Support or other Departments (like Customer Success) can provide.

## Using the Urgent Tag

When the problem a customer is encountering is preventing them from accepting live donations (after a period of having successfully accepted them), this is an urgent issue. The customer needs actionable support, and to be treated with urgency and accuracy. 

The mechanical way we handle this is via the Urgent tag in Help Scout. All replies on urgent-tagged tickets should be placed back in the "Unassigned" Help Scout box so that they receive attention as soon as possible. 

This requires some discretion on the part of us as support technicians: just because an issue is urgent to a customer does not make it an urgent-tagged ticket.

Even if the person contacting us is on a tight deadline and has tremendous urgency, it does not fit the criteria for the urgent tag unless the site was previously accepting donations and now is no longer. 

By this definition, a site that is not live yet or has never taken donations before can't have an urgent-tagged issue. 

### Responding to Urgent tagged tickets

When a ticket is marked as urgent (according to the above definition) and left in the unassigned box, all technicians on the unassigned box are to prioritize it. 

That doesn't necessarily mean that they should be the one to answer, but that they should alert the technician who tagged it to answer when there is a response from the customer. 

If the original technician is out for the day at the time of the customer response, the remaining technician(s) should take over the ticket, and respond. As long as the issue is still urgent, we leave the ticket in the unassigned box tagged as urgent. 

## Escalating Tickets To Senior Support Technicians

Another aspect of frictionless support is escalating tickets to Senior Support Technicians. The goal is to only respond to the customer with actionable, helpful, and constructive responses. 

To say "I am looping in a Senior support technician" to the customer adds friction, and should only be used as a [Queue Health Habit](../daily-routine/queue-health-habits.md) to get a response to the customer before logging off for the day. It would be far better to have a conversation with the Senior Support Technician and then respond with a fix for the issue. 

### Mechanics of Escalation

The point of escalating a ticket is to signal to a Senior Support Technician "I don't know what else to do to resolve this issue." For mechanics of _how_ to do certain tasks, [Slack calls](../communicating-as-a-team/using-slack.md) are a better choice. 

If a Support Technician finds themselves stuck on what else to do, we escalate the ticket via a note in Help Scout. The singular focus of that note is to bring the Senior Support Technician up to speed on the ticket without having to read through the entire thing. We use the canned response in Help Scout to answer most thoroughly. 

Once the ticket has been escalated, **we leave it assigned to the original technician** unless otherwise instructed. This allows for the technician to monitor whether the Senior Support Technician has gotten to it, and if they haven't, to either remind them or notify the customer before logging off for the day. 

Here's our escalation note template:
> I need assistance with this ticket. Here's all the necessary information.
>
> 1. Rate the Urgency
{1 == not urgent, just need help; 2 == Some urgency from the customer, but I can do it with some help; 3 == Urgency from Customer and I don't know how to resolve this for them at all.}
>
> 2. Quick Summary of the Problem
{summarize the users problem succinctly}
>
> 3. How Did I Verify the Problem? 
{Did you replicate it outside the user's site? (provide steps); Saw it on the user's site? (provide steps), Have additional info like screenshots? (provide them in the Note)}
>
> 4. What I think Resolution Looks Like
{describe what a Great Rating resolution for this ticket would look like}
>
> 5. What is keeping me from Resolution
{describe what is keeping you from getting that Great Rating resolution. If it's development, then focus on the Github issue, not escalating this ticket in Support}

### Angry Customers
The other reason for escalating a ticket is if the customer is demonstrably angry or belligerent. Often an angry customer (in addition to simply needing to be handled per our [tone guide](tone-guide.md)'s principle of "results oriented") simply needs to hear from a different technician, and they respond well to titles like "Senior," "Director," or "Head." 

In the case of an angry customer, we have a conversation in Slack about it, deciding whether escalation is necessary. 

## Assigning Tickets To Other Technicians

The Senior Support technician has the role of "Queue Master" which includes assigning tickets to specific support technicians to ensure that everyone has a fair load of responsibilities. 

It's also appropriate in the interest of frictionless support for technicians to communicate among themselves and assign tickets as appropriate. 

Valid reasons for assigning a ticket to another technician (with their knowledge and permission) include:
- the technician has more experience with a certain payment gateway, add-on, or functionality. 
- the technician has a server or local environment better suited for testing and reproducing the customer's issue.
- the technician is in a time zone better suited for helping the customer in need of more "real-time" assistance.

The key to assigning things to other technicians is that it requires a conversation via Slack (in the public support channel) where both technicians agree to it. 

## Involving other Departments

Customers will occasionally have questions about their account at GiveWP, or they might want a live Demo, they might have problems with managing their licenses, or (worst case) they might need a refund. 

In order to keep the customer experience frictionless, Support Technicians should reassign tickets to the appropriate person or department immediately with a note that helps focus what action should be taken. This way the next interaction the customer receives is actionable, and not a reassignment update.

If the question is solely about a non-technical issue, we move the conversation to the customer success inbox in Help Scout (leaving it assigned to anyone and active) without answering. 

If there are multiple issues (some technical and some for the Customer Success team) we interface with the customer success team in their Slack channel, and resolve as much as possible, responding to the customer with both the tech support answers and the customer success answers. 

This means that if we have access to the back end of a customer site having license issues, we interface with the customer success team to make sure that the issues are handled, and then respond to the customer to say "we made sure the correct licenses are added to your site, and you are good to go!"

Another case for involving another department is when we identify a good candidate for a Give Story or collaboration with the content team. In this case, we take the initiative to invite them to submit a Give Story via the form on our site. 

## Summary

Friction in customer interactions is a dehumanizing thing, causing customers to feel like livestock being herded into line, or a number on the ticket queue to be handled.
