# Providing an Effective First Response

Intro paragraph

## Timely 

Upon submitting a support ticket, our customers receive notice that we will respond within 2-4 business hours. Business hours are from 5AM to 5PM Pacific time. During these hours, unless otherwise instructed by the Head of Support or Senior Support Technician, support techs should be aware of and answering tickets in the unassigned box.

## Thorough

In addition to being prompt in our reply, our first response seeks to solve the customer’s problem. That includes not only answering with concrete steps to resolve, but anticipating all possible outcomes and answering for these outcomes, in the first response. 

For example, if a support tech recommends disabling caching temporarily and submitting test donations, the response should include how to resolve things if that troubleshooting step worked (exclude the correct pages and/or queries from the cache) or if it didn’t (try another troubleshooting step).

There should never be an opportunity for a customer to say “I did that, and it didn’t work. What next?” The first response should end with a resolution, or concrete next steps that give us the ability to get closer to a resolution.

The goal of the first reply is to resolve the issue, and limit the number of replies to resolve. “I did that, what next?” is a wasted opportunity to get access credentials, or some other information that will push us closer to a resolution.

## Friendly

Customers are never a bother, and being able to help them with issues is a pleasure. We indicate this to them by making sure our responses are friendly, warm, and disarming. If a customer apologies for “bothering” us, we reassure them that it’s not a bother.

When appropriate, light-hearted humor can work well. Note: If a customer is having a major issue (donations stopped on the live site, and they are frustrated, for example) this is not the appropriate time for humor. 

Talk to the customer as you would a friend. More on this in the Tone Guide later, but the following phrases work well:
* “We’ve got you covered!”
* “Your site looks great!”
* “Way to go!”

## Empathetic

Related to being friendly, we strive for empathy—putting ourselves into the shoes of our customers—in order to feel what they are feeling. A frustrated customer needs a helping hand up, a happy customer needs encouragement and applause, a misinformed customer needs kind information. 

We don’t waste time defending ourselves: we solve problems. The first response should set the tone that the customer is heard, valued, and a priority for us.
