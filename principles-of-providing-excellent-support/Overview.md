## Principles of Providing Excellent Support Overview
We solve customer problems. To do that, we must be (in no particular order)

1. [Capable of getting to resolution](getting-to-resolution.md)
2. [Knowledgeable about the product](knowing-the-product.md)
3. [Able to set the correct tone for the interaction](tone-guide.md). 

A support tech with 1 and 2 but not 3 is nicknamed _Jerk Superstar_: 
- efficient and prompt. 
- can spot a technical problem extremely quickly.
- customers (and potentially team members) don't like them.

A support tech with 2 and 3 but not 1 is nicknamed _Return to Pender_: 
- sets great tone and everyone loves them. 
- knows the product inside and out.
- can't connect the problem with a solution for the customer. They end up escalating everything.

A support tech with 1 and 3 but not 2 is nicknamed _Bumbling Bestie_: 
- excels in empathy, tone, and team culture
- the type of person you love hanging out with
- Can't solve the problem for the customer because they don't know the product. 

None of the team has "arrived" in any of the three areas, and we are all growing and helping each other to grow. Recognizing areas of weakness and working on them makes the whole team better.
