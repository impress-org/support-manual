# Weekly Meetings

As a distributed team, we prioritize getting together via video chat once per week for a weekly support meeting. The purpose of the meeting is threefold: alignment, course-correction, and motivation. Each of these involve two-way communication.

## Team Alignment
When we meet, it's a time to make sure all team members, regardless of [team role](team-roles.md), are on the same page as far as how the team is doing. The Head of Support briefly goes through the metrics from the previous week, with respect to how they apply to the support team.

In the sample data is 'Sales +/-: 14% Decrease, New Tickets +/-: 0% increase, Tickets/sales: 82%, Productivity: 1st reply 2.5 hours, Happiness: 100 % from 10% of customers, Free Support: 25 interaction with 1 5-star and 87% resolved, Capacity 98%'](../assets/report-sample-group.png)

If there are any anomalies on the reports in terms of week-over-week change, the team discusses them. 

After the team overview, the Head of Support guides the team through individual metrics from the previous week.

This portion of the meeting is not meant to be negative, or finger-pointing, but instead corrective and encouraging. When something is going right for a tech, or there is significant improvement, there's often discussion surrounding what changed or enabled that difference. 

## Course-Correction

Far from being a top-down dictation of the facts and direction of the company or support team, the weekly meeting is specifically designed to surface customer issues and trends. Since the support technicians are the front-line ambassadors between custer and product team (and vice versa), the weekly meeting is an opportunity to allow support techs to voice the concerns of the customer, to discuss among the team how to deal with the issues customers are seeing, and to give the Head of Support insight into how to escalate issues to the product team.

It's also a chance to see how the team is working together, and in what way processes can be streamlined and fixed going forward.

## Motivation

Working as a distributed team can be isolating. The weekly meeting is an opportunity to spend time together which also has the effect of motivating and encouraging on another. An intentional community-building thing that we do from time to time is have a brief discussion of a piece of content tangentially related to support in general or digital business. 

Weekly meetings are a critical component to having a healthy support team. Barring vacation or sick time, it's expected that support technicians block out and guard the time for weekly meetings.
