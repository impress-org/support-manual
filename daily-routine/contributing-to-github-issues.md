# Creating and Contributing to Github Issues
As a part of our role as customer ambassador, when we find an issue in the plugin or an add-on, we escalate the issue to the product team in the form of an issue on GitHub. This is done during ticket time, as a part of the flow.

The following are all valid reasons to create an issue:
## Bugs
If in the course of replicating customer issues we find a bug that is replicable in a separate environment, we should immediately create an issue on GitHub in the appropriate repository. Keep in mind that issues created in public repositories are visible by anyone, and should use discretion when it comes to discussing internal policy or issues. 

In creating the issue, we take care to ensure that the developer tasked with replicating the problem has all necessary information to quickly replicate the problem, and find a solution. It is the job of the support technician to help the developer anticipate how fixing the bug could impact other use-cases of the plugin or add-on. We know (with more clarity that the developers) how our users are using the plugins, and should give them as much context as possible.
## Feature requests
When a customer requests a new feature, we listen. As support technicians, it is not our job to weigh the validity or feasibility of a feature request, so much as to keep a record of how many customers are asking for certain features. For the purposes of creating issues for feature requests, all of those should be routed through the senior support technicians or the head of support, for simplicity. 

Any time we create an issue on GitHub, we notate the ticket with GitHub URL and the GitHub issue with the Help Scout URL.
