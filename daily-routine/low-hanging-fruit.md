# Low Hanging Fruit / Fire Patrol
The first thing a support technician does is to read through all the tickets, identifying “Low Hanging Fruit” (LHF) to send a quick reply to or to delegate appropriately. As a rule, LHF is defined as something that can be answered or dealt with without having to look anything up. By that definition, it is no surprise that the more experienced technicians will be able to clear more LHF. 

Simultaneously, while doing the first read through of all unassigned tickets, support technicians are on “fire patrol” looking out for issues that should immediately be escalated to the Product team or the Head of Support. 

Three examples of “fires” would be:
* Reports of our product website being down
* Reports of customers being unable to purchase
* Donor cards being charged incorrectly

In each case, problems should be verified and validated, and then immediately escalated to Head of Support.
